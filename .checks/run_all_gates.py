"""Run every gate in order and stop at the first failure.

    python .checks/run_all_gates.py
    SKIP_RERUN=1 python .checks/run_all_gates.py   (skip the reproducibility re-run)

A failing gate is not a warning. The phase it guards is not complete, and the
work that depends on it is not to be trusted until the cause is fixed. A skipped
check asserts nothing, so the summary reports skips beside the gate that took
them.
